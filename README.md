Create an app for text files writing and reading.
Two functions :
Create and write text files
List text files on UI to read by clicking
How to store text files :
Use database with three columns, ID, NAME, and PATH, to store file information
Store text files in internal or external storage
UI thread is only to update UI. So you should do IO in background.
